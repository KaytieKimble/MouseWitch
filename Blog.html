		<h1> The Mouse-Witch</h1>
		<p> Greetings! My name is Elora Three, and I am, as you might have guessed, a mouse and a witch! </p>

		<p> I wanted to share a few things you might search for on a misty morning of foraging... </p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.novembersage.com/">The types of things this site carries</a></li>
			<li>A sproutling of a tree, wet with morning dew, to be fashioned into a wand once dried and charmed</li>
			<li>Some red berries for Savhir, the Night of Untold Magic at the eve of the winter season</li>
			<li>Anything that you know to be not poisonous, but that brings a smell of warmth and loveliness once crushed in a mortar and pestle and added to the mixture for candles</li>
			<li>Twenty-six or so mushrooms, pale brown in hue</li>
				<ul>
					<li>These, of course, are for the morn after Savhir</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Whatever your wee heart desires!</li>
		</ul>
